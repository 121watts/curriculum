The goal of this project is to create a JSON API and write a ruby gem wrapper to consume that API.

You will receive 1 technology and 2 APIs to integrate with, and of the three you much choose 2 of them.

You may barter your integrations and technologies with other students in the
class.

### Learning Goals

* Publish an API, with accompanying client gem, and consume your API internally.
* Continue to emphasize performance, UI, and overall user experience.

### Teams and Process

No teams.

You are welcome to collaborate/pair on each others' code, and have stand-ups
with the others for accountability.

### Project Planning

* Fork and clone [the submissions repo](https://github.com/gSchool/submissions)
* copy (do not rename) the
`/projects/individual_projects/lastname_firstname.rb` file and name it with
your own last name and first name
* edit the file you just created to fill out all the required data. The `project_description` field should be a fairly short summary of your idea.
* submit a pull request, entering your suggested MVP and how you intend to use the technologies/integrations for your project.

The pull request is where we are going to discuss whether or not your idea is good/complete/too big/too small/too vague.

If you have a huge idea and can break it into MVP and small iterations in the
pull request, we may go for it with the understanding that you probably won't
finish the whole thing.

## Base Expectations

You're expected to complete the following functional and non-functional requirements, which describe an application and accompanying gem that function as a user activity feed, API consumer, and API producer.

You will also need to focus on an excellent user experience, and your stakeholders will emphasize that when reviewing and accepting stories during the show and tell sessions.
