In this project you'll take an existing application and practice breaking logic and functionality into a cluster of smaller services.

## High-Level Goals

At a high-level, we're studying:

* How a services architecture works
* What parts of an application can become services
* How services affect our development processes

In addition, we're practicing fundamental techniques like:

* Pushing logic down the stack
* Testing of complex systems
* Managing deployment of multiple applications

## Planning Topics

### Process

* BDD
  * Black-box testing
  * Characterization tests
  * Tracking the growth/shrink of views
* Red/Green/Refactor
* Deployment
* Pushing logic down the stack

### Technical

* Creating a gem
* JSON
* Authentication
* REST
* VCR
* Petroglyph
* Redis
  * Pub/Sub
  * Async
  * Alternatives
* ElasticSearch
* Capybara + Poltergeist
* JavaScript
  * Accessing data on a server
  * Manipulating the DOM
  * Masking Latency

### Prep

* Watch Chris Kellyâ€™s talk
* Setup for using localhost, ex lvh.me?

### Etc

* CodeClimate
* Git practices

## Introducing Services

### Fractal Design

* SOLID and SRP
* Apply it several layers of abstraction
  * Line of code
  * Method
  * Class
  * **Application**

### Definitions and Concepts

* A **Service**, strictly speaking is A but for our purposes, it's B
* A **Message** is how one application communicates with another
* A **Message Service** is the channel which accepts and delivers a message
* **Pub/Sub** is a messaging architecture which allows multiple subscribers to listen to a single publisher

### Services within MVC

#### The Proxy Approach

* Starting with a traditional MVC layout
* The model is responsible for domain logic and data access
* Services are data and domain logic
* As such, they should be encapsulated down at the model layer
* The controller and view shouldn't know that the service exists

#### The Smart Client Approach

* The primary app doesn't have to know everything
* It's acting as a middleman
* We can take advantage of smart JavaScript clients
* Treat the client as the proxy
* Directly access the services and manipulate the DOM
* Completely remove the service from the primary app's MVC

### How Messaging Works

* Install Redis
* Create a publisher
* Create a subscriber
* Publish a message
* See it
* Create another subscriber
* Publish a message
* See it

### Identifying a Service

A good candidate for extraction to a service...

* Has limited and known interactions with other parts of the domain logic
* Are a conceptual piece of value rather than a just a piece of functionality
* Could potentially be reused in a different application

Poor candidates for service extraction...

* Need access to large pieces of data from the primary application
* Are reading and writing primary application data
* ???

### The Pros and Cons

#### Pros

* lower churn
* connect for free / low cost
* redundancy
* easier to reason about
* scaling
* reuse
* uncoupled deployment
* reimplement / experiments

#### Cons

* deployment / ops
* versioning
* testing
* http requests
* duplication (creating POROs)

### The Process of Building a Service

Duplicate, Validate, Delete:

1. Implement message creation
2. Build the service to consume those messages
3. Validate the functionality of the service in parallel with the primary application
4. Remove functionality from the primary application
