## Schedule

* Begin reading as soon as possible
* "Reading Group 1" will take place next Monday
* "Reading Group 2" will take place the following Monday
* "Reading Group 3" will take place the third Monday
* "Author Conversation" will (hopefully) take place during RG3

## Reading Group 1

### Preparation

Before RG1, you need to:

* Read Part I: The Basics (Chapters 1 through 9)
* Write a blog reflection detailed below

### Writing

On your class blog, write an article that explores one or more of the following questions:

* What's something that really "clicked" for you? Why/how? (Ex: Symbols, Dynamic Typing, etc)
* Was there something you thought you understood, but are now more confused about?
* Chapter 5 focuses on Regular Expressions. Do you feel like they're a tool you'll reach for, or try to avoid?
* How would you explain Mocks and Stubs?

### Group Session

In our small-group sessions:

* Gather in your four-person groups
* 36 Minutes: For each person in your group
  * 7 Minutes: Read their entry
  * 2 Minutes: Add a comment
  * 3 Minutes: Evaluate the entry at http://eval.jumpstartlab.com
* 15 Minutes: Group Discusion (below)

Have a discussion in your small group reflecting on any of the following questions:

* Discuss one of the topics a group member was confused about and see if the rest of the group can make sense of it.
* How are you feeling about regular expressions? Do you know what kinds of situations they're useful in? Could you construct a Regular Expression if you wanted to?
* Based on our conversation about inheritance this morning, do `private` and `protected` methods make more sense? Why would you use them? Why can't you consider them "secure" in Ruby?
* Now that you've written MiniTest tests and seen RSpec in the book, what do you like and dislike about each? Why do you think RSpec is becoming so popular? When would you favor MiniTest?
