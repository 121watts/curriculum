## Reading Group 1

### Preparation

Before RG1, you need to:

* Read Part I: The Basics (Chapters 1 through 9)
* Write a blog reflection detailed below

### Writing

On your class blog, write an article that explores one or more of the following questions:

* What's something that really "clicked" for you? Why/how? (Ex: Symbols, Dynamic Typing, etc)
* Was there something you thought you understood, but are now more confused about?
* Chapter 5 focuses on Regular Expressions. Do you feel like they're a tool you'll reach for, or try to avoid?
* How would you explain Mocks and Stubs?
