#### Stefan Wintermeyer's [Ruby on Rails 4.0 Guide](http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Rails-4-0-Guide-guide/dp/1491054484/ref=pd_sim_b_20)

We don't have first-hand experience with this book. It sounds like the English/writing is a bit rough, but the technical explanations are good. It's geared towards people who are new to Ruby and to Rails.

#### Michael Hartl's [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book?version=4.0#top)

The Rails Tutorial is one of the most popular texts for learning Rails has been updated for Rails 4. It takes the approach of building a sample app and tying in all the key concepts. It integrates testing throughout, but it's done in RSpec.

This text is only available in electronic editions, but it is free.

This text is ancient in the tech world, but it was one of the first to really open the door to RESTful web architecture. This is a good fit for you if you feel comfortable building basic Rails applications, but want to understand more about how to model more complex domains without tripping over yourself.
