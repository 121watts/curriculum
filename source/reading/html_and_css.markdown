## Reading Group 1

### Preparation

Before RG1, you need to:

* Read Chapters 1 through 7

### Group Session

In our small-group sessions:

* Gather in your four-person groups
* 25 Minutes: Discuss the questions below
* 35 Minutes: Write a reflection on your blog as outlined below

#### Discussion

Have a discussion in your small group reflecting on any of the following questions:

* What was something new to you about HTML from the first chapters?
* Was there a concept or idea that didn't make any sense? Or what was most confusing?
* Did you put any of the techniques into practice yet? What were the results?
* If you've written HTML in the past, did you notice anything new about HTML5?

#### Writing

Write a short article on your class blog based on the concept or technique that was most confusing or difficult for you. Your article should:

* Set the context of why you were learning about the technique
* Explain it to the best of your ability
* Use code samples
* Put it into practice within the article itself

Ideally push the article up by the end of the session, but if you need more time feel free to finish it that evening.

Now that you have an array of both HTML and CSS tools, put them to work on your blog and write an article explaining the process and techniques. It should:

* Explain the motivations of why you used the techniques
* Include before and after code samples to demonstrate the changes
* Use cropped screen shots to demonstrate the before-and-after effects
