## Ruby Fundamentals

#### Chris Pine's [Learn to Program](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356360/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1934356360&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

This is a good choice for people who are struggling with the fundamentals of Ruby syntax and want to review things starting from scratch.

#### Dave Thomas' [Programming Ruby 1.9 & 2.0](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937785491/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1937785491&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

This is a good choice for people who are feeling functional with the basics, but would like a bit more depth and breadth. This book is written in two parts, you'd focus on the front half which is a tutorial. The back half is more of a reference.

#### Russ Olsen's [Eloquent Ruby](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321584104/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321584104&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

If Ruby syntax is comfortable and you want to understand the _style_ behind writing good Ruby, this book is for you. Every student should read it at some point during our class.

#### Andy Hunt's [Pragmatic Thinking & Learning](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356050/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1934356050&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

If you'd like something less technical, this book is rich with ideas about how to learn effectively -- especially as a developer.

## HTML & CSS Fundamentals

#### Jon Duckett's [HTML & CSS](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118008189/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1118008189&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

If you aren't very familiar with HTML and CSS, this is an excellent introduction to each of the components and their usage. It's really well designed, but is laid out more as a reference than a story. It's kind of like reading a very beautiful, well-written dictionary. If you like reading in short bursts, this is a good fit.

#### Elisabeth Robson's [Head First HTML & CSS](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596159900/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596159900&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

Head First books are different than any other technical book -- you'll love it or hate it. Take a look at the sample pages before selecting this one.

This book is a good fit if you've either (a) never done anything with HTML/CSS or (b) feel like your foundation is shaky.

#### A Book Apart's CSS3 and HTML5 Books

If you've spent time with HTML and CSS but would like to sharpen your skills with the latest and greatest features of HTML**5** and CSS**3**, dig into these two short books from A Book Apart:

* [HTML5 for Web Designers](http://www.abookapart.com/products/html5-for-web-designers)
* [CSS3 for Web Designers](http://www.abookapart.com/products/css3-for-web-designers)

#### Dan Cedarholm's [Bulletproof Web
Design](http://astore.amazon.com/simplebits-20/detail/0321808355)

Dan Cedarholm has written multiple books regarding solid html/css practices.
Bulletproof Web Design goes over html/css topics by showing an example of how
a current website implements a solution - and then explains why that solution is
not "bulletproof" - essentially why it could break in the real world. 

He then will show you true bulletproof solutions to the problem given, and how
to implement them.

This book is great for those already comfortable with html/css and would like to
know how to build stronger markup/style foundations in their websites.


#### Brian Miller's [Above the Fold](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/144030842X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=144030842X&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

If you've got a decent toolbox of HTML and CSS knowledge, then the next challenge is how to design sites/applications from a high level. This book steps above the implementation nuts and bolts and focuses on the *why* in web design.

## Rails Fundamentals

#### Stefan Wintermeyer's [Ruby on Rails 4.0 Guide](http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Rails-4-0-Guide-guide/dp/1491054484/ref=pd_sim_b_20)

We don't have first-hand experience with this book. It sounds like the English/writing is a bit rough, but the technical explanations are good. It's geared towards people who are new to Ruby and to Rails.

#### Michael Hartl's [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book?version=4.0#top)

The Rails Tutorial is one of the most popular texts for learning Rails has been updated for Rails 4. It takes the approach of building a sample app and tying in all the key concepts. It integrates testing throughout, but it's done in RSpec.

This text is only available in electronic editions, but it is free.

#### Bruce Williams & John Athayde's [The Rails View](http://www.amazon.com/The-Rails-View-Maintainable-Experience/dp/1934356875/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&qid=1382969067&sr=8-14&keywords=rails)

This intermediate text is a good choice if you feel comfortable building basic Rails applications and would like to focus on ways to build modular, maintainable view-layer code. Note that it targets Rails 3, but differences should be minor.

#### Leonard Richardson's [RESTful Web Services](http://www.amazon.com/Restful-Web-Services-Leonard-Richardson/dp/0596529260/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1382972055&sr=1-3&keywords=REST)

This text is ancient in the tech world, but it was one of the first to really open the door to RESTful web architecture. This is a good fit for you if you feel comfortable building basic Rails applications, but want to understand more about how to model more complex domains without tripping over yourself.

#### Jose Valim's [Crafting Rails 4 Applications](http://pragprog.com/book/jvrails2/crafting-rails-4-applications)

This is an advanced text for those who have built several Rails applications. The Rails 4 edition is only available as a beta PDF at this time.
