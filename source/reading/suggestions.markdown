## Ruby Fundamentals

#### Chris Pine's [Learn to Program](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356360/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1934356360&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

This is a good choice for people who are struggling with the fundamentals of Ruby syntax and want to review things starting from scratch.

#### Dave Thomas' [Programming Ruby 1.9 & 2.0](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937785491/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1937785491&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

This is a good choice for people who are feeling functional with the basics, but would like a bit more depth and breadth. This book is written in two parts, you'd focus on the front half which is a tutorial. The back half is more of a reference.

#### Russ Olsen's [Eloquent Ruby](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321584104/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321584104&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

If Ruby syntax is comfortable and you want to understand the _style_ behind writing good Ruby, this book is for you. Every student should read it at some point during our class.

#### Andy Hunt's [Pragmatic Thinking & Learning](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356050/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1934356050&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

If you'd like something less technical, this book is rich with ideas about how to learn effectively -- especially as a developer.

## HTML & CSS Fundamentals

#### Jon Duckett's [HTML & CSS](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118008189/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1118008189&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

If you aren't very familiar with HTML and CSS, this is an excellent introduction to each of the components and their usage. It's really well designed, but is laid out more as a reference than a story. It's kind of like reading a very beautiful, well-written dictionary. If you like reading in short bursts, this is a good fit.

#### Elisabeth Robson's [Head First HTML & CSS](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596159900/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596159900&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

Head First books are different than any other technical book -- you'll love it or hate it. Take a look at the sample pages before selecting this one.

This book is a good fit if you've either (a) never done anything with HTML/CSS or (b) feel like your foundation is shaky.

#### A Book Apart's CSS3 and HTML5 Books

If you've spent time with HTML and CSS but would like to sharpen your skills with the latest and greatest features of HTML**5** and CSS**3**, dig into these two short books from A Book Apart:

* [HTML5 for Web Designers](http://www.abookapart.com/products/html5-for-web-designers)

#### Brian Miller's [Above the Fold](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/144030842X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=144030842X&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

If you've got a decent toolbox of HTML and CSS knowledge, then the next challenge is how to design sites/applications from a high level. This book steps above the implementation nuts and bolts and focuses on the *why* in web design.
