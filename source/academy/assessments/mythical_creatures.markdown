## Expectations

* Work on the exercise defined below for 25 minutes with your facilitator
* Then spend approximately 3 minutes going over your scores
* The facilitator may change the spec or ask additional questions to assess your understandings/skills
* As you work, you may:
  * Ask questions of your facilitator
  * Reference external public resources (ie: Google, Ruby API, etc)
  * Use the tooling most comfortable to you (Editor/IDE, testing framework, support tools, etc)
* As you work, you should not:
  * Copy code snippets other than those present in this description
  * Seek live support from individuals other than your facilitator
* After you complete the exercise, please exercise discretion with your classmates to allow them an authentic evaluation experience

## Preparation

Create a *new* clone of the `ruby-exercises` repo:

* switch to the directory where you'll keep your projects
* clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-exercises.git`
* change to the mythical creatures directory: `cd ruby-exercises/mythical-creatures`
* open the folder in your editor: `atom .`

## Work Plan

Work through the following exercises in order. You're not expected to finish all of them:

* Medusa
* Werewolf
* Centaur

## Evaluation

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

### 1. Ruby Syntax & API

* 4: Developer is able to write Ruby with a minimum of reference or debugging
* 3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts
* 2: Developer is generally able to write Ruby, but gets stuck on or needs help with fundamental concepts
* 1: Developer spends significant time debugging elementary syntax or concepts
* 0: Developer struggles with basic Ruby syntax

### 2. Ruby Style

* 4: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity
* 3: Developer refactors for clarity but has some areas for improvement
* 2: Developer does not refactor for clarity
* 1: Developer writes code with unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity
* 0: Developer writes code that is difficult to understand

### 3. Testing

* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for *both* design and verification
* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design
* 2: Developer uses and writes tests to guide development, but implements more functionality than the tests cover
* 1: Developer is able to use existing tests, but not write new ones
* 0: Developer does not use tests to guide development

### 4. Workflow

* 4: Developer is a master of their tools, effeciently moving between phases of development
* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts
* 2: Developer smoothly moves between tools, but is dependent on mouse-driven interaction
* 1: Developer gets work done, but wastes significant time or screen real estate
* 0: Developer struggles to effectively use the Terminal, the file system, or their editor without direct support

### 5. Collaboration

* 4: Developer *actively seeks* collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck
* 3: Developer lays out their thinking *before* attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process
* 2: Developer asks detailed questions when progress slows or stops
* 1: Developer is able to integrate unsolicited feedback but does not really collaborate
* 0: Developer needs more than two reminders to "think out loud" or struggles to articulate their process
