## Schedule

* Begin reading as soon as possible
* "Reading Group 1" will take place next Monday
* "Reading Group 2" will take place the following Monday

## Reading Group 1

### Preparation

Before RG1, you need to:

* Read Part I: Choosing Your Market
* Read Part II: Investing in Your Product
* Read Part III: Executing
* Write a blog reflection detailed below

### Writing

On your class blog, write an article that explores one or more of the following questions:

* Was there a tip that rung true with your past experience in a field other than programming? How was it similar?
* Was there a tip that you disagreed with? How/why?
* Some of the tips seem obvious, but what was one that surprised you?
* Which tip would be the hardest for you to implement and why? What systems/support can you use to make it work?

### Group Session

In our small-group sessions:

* Gather in your four-person groups
* 36 Minutes: For each person in your group
  * 7 Minutes: Read their entry
  * 2 Minutes: Add a comment
  * 3 Minutes: Evaluate the entry at http://eval.jumpstartlab.com
* 15 Minutes: Group Discusion (below)

Have a discussion in your small group reflecting on any of the following questions:

* Do you think there's a difference between being a "coder", a "programmer", a "developer", and an "architect"? What kind of role is the author pushing you towards? What do you actually want to be?
* Endurance athletes are at their peak after age 30. What age range do you think is the peak performance for programmers? How do the author's tips inform your thinking?
* Do you know another spoken language besides English? If not, why? If so, how does it affect/inform/degrade your English? How do you think this relates to programming languages?
