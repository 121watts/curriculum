## jQuery Workshop

Today let's do a workshop session around jQuery to close our reading of "jQuery: Novice to Ninja".

### Workshop Rules

Here are the rules for creating teams:

* You'll gather in groups of three to five
* You can't be in a group with anyone from your project team
* The group captains will each select a topic
* As a non-captain, you can choose which group to join provided there are fewer than 5 (total) in that group and that no one from your project team is in that group

### Special Note for this Workshop

Normally, workshops should not produce any code of value. However, since today's session is substituting for your reading group on "jQuery: Novice to Ninja" you may use code you write to fulfill the expectations here:

Please try to respect the workshop spirit and push yourself to try something interesting/challenging with jQuery without getting sucked into unrelated parts of your project.
