## SSL - Cryptography Concepts

* Encryption / Decryption (symmetric) like AES
* Public / Private keys (asymmetric) like RSA
* Key size, perfect security versus computational security
  * Brute force, factoring
  * 2^n bits
  * Symmetric are "stronger": 1024-bit RSA =~ 80-bit AES
  * 128-bit AES considered "out of reach"
* Export & "Munitions"
