## Merging Patches

Now recollect in your project group and review the patches submitted to your code. 

* If they're good, merge them in and post a thanks comment.
* If they're not, write a detailed note about why the patch was rejected.
* Make sure everything still works correctly and get it up in production for tomorrow!
