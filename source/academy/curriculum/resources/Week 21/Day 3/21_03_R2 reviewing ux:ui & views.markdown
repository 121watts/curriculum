## Round 2 -- 10:30 to 12:00

### Revewing UX/UI and Views

* Project 1: 
* Project 2: 
* Project 3: 
* Project 4: 
* Project 5: 
* Project 6: 

#### Questions to Consider

* Are the views well organized? (naming, formatting)
* Do they make effective use of partials to promote reuse and avoid repetition?
* Do they use view helpers or model methods to avoid logic in the views?
* What parts of the visual design work well? What needs improvement?
* How is the error feedback? What happens when you put in invalid data?
* Is the site responsive? Would you want to keep using it?
