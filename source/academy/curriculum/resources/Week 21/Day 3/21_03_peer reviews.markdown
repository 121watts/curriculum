## Peer Reviews

This morning you'll pair up to critique aspects of each other's projects and make suggestions for improvement. Each pair will be assigned a project and an area of focus.

### Protocol

Get together with your pair and:

#### 1. Setup for Development (<15 minutes)

1. Clone the code from Github
2. Get it running by following the README
3. Install any dependencies
4. Generate seed data if needed
5. Make sure that all the tests pass
6. Get it running through the browser in development

#### 2. Evaluate (~25 minutes)

1. Evaluate your area of focus
2. Make notes about weaknesses
3. Create a github issue for **each** discrete issue you find
4. Include evidence from the code (*ex: "The challenge model is inadequately tested"*)

#### 3. Patch (~35 minutes)

1. Create a new git branch
2. Implement one your suggestions from the evaluation
3. Verify that it works
4. Push to github
5. Submit a pull request which includes notes about *why* you made these changes
6. Return to the master branch
7. `GOTO` step 1
