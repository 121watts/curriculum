title: Round 2 - Reviewing Controllers
---

## Round 2 -- 10:30 to 12:00

### Reviewing Controllers

* Project 1: 
* Project 2: 
* Project 3: 
* Project 4: 
* Project 5: 
* Project 6: 

### Questions to Consider

* Are the controller methods very short?
* Do they create a minimum number of instance variables, or should they use a facade object?
* Is the logic pushed down to the model?
* Are dependencies (like the caching mechanism) adequately pushed down to the model layer?
* Are queries done in a secure way to avoid SQL injection, privledge escalation, etc?
* Is there any documentation for API methods about the inputs and outputs?
