### Reviewing Tests

* Project 1: 
* Project 2: 
* Project 3: 
* Project 4: 
* Project 5: 
* Project 6: 

##### Questions to Consider

* Are there unit tests for each model?
* Are there integration tests for each major screen/view?
* Are there controller tests for any API calls?
* Do the tests adequately cover the application's functionality?
* Do they use good style and take advantage of test framework features? (`let`, `before`, etc)
* Do they stub/mock out any external services?
* Do the unit tests truely only test one component?
