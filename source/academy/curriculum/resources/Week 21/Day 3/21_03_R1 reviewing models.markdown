## Round 1 -- 9:00 to 10:30

### Reviewing Models

* Project 1: 
* Project 2: 
* Project 3: 
* Project 4: 
* Project 5:
* Project 6: 

##### Questions to Consider

* Do the models use good encapsulation?
* Is there a separation of public/private methods?
* Are the methods well named?
* Are the methods small, comprising a single purpose?
* Can some of the Ruby style be simplified?
* Is there documentation for the public methods?
* Is potentially-reusable code pulled out into modules?
* Has "magic data" been pulled out to constants? Or a configuration file/initializer?
