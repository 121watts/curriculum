## Cane Gem

Evaluate each other's code with the help of the Cane gem. Let's try it out:

```
gem install cane
```

Then from your project directory:

```
cane --style-glob '**/*.rb' --abc-glob '**/*.rb'
```

Try fixing some of the issues it highlights. If your lines are too long, break them into variables or small method calls.
