## Delete a key class

From your project directory, make sure you've got everything currently checked into a git repo.

Then delete one of the key files in your project. I'll recommend the `Attendee` class.

How could you re-imagine it? Can you reconstruct the system to a working state using a dramatically different structure? If you used `OpenStruct`, rebuild it with normal attributes. Think about smaller methods. Pull code in or push it out to other classes.
