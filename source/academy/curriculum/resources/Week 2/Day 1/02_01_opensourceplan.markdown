## Open Source Plan

*Everyone* needs to complete an open source plan. Go to 
[http://eval.jumpstartlab.com](http://eval.jumpstartlab.com) and look for the form.

You have about 4.5 hours to work on this project. Make it count. Be realistic about what you're capable of completing. If you want to dig into code, do it. If you want to work on documentation, do that.

Some ideas:

* `EventManager`
  * Are there places that need better explanation?
  * Any errors?
  * Create a reference implementation with documentation
* `JSTwitter`
  * Add new iterations
  * Smooth out any issues you encountered
  * Post a reference implementation
* `OpenStruct`
  * Write an explanitary tutorial about OpenStruct
  * Include exercises
* `Evaluator`
  * Work on the `Evaluator` app to improve the design, workflow, etc
* Lightning Talks
  * Edit the lightning talk videos
  * Re-record lightning talks into tight, scripted screencasts
* Class Materials
  * Edit & publish screencasts
  * Write blog post(s) about activities
  * Work on the HungryAcademy.com site
* Miscellaneous Projects
  * Cane gem
  * JumpstartAuth gem
