## Faye Workshop

Faye is an awesome library to manage live connections between server and clients. 

Let's all practice working with Faye. Break into your groups and:

1. Watch and *work through* the Faye episode on [RailsCasts: http://railscasts.com/episodes/260-messaging-with-faye](http://railscasts.com/episodes/260-messaging-with-faye)
2. Watch and *work through* the PrivatePub episode on [RailsCasts: http://railscasts.com/episodes/316-private-pub](RailsCasts: http://railscasts.com/episodes/316-private-pub)
3. Implement pub/sub on JSBlogger (`git://github.com/JumpstartLab/jsblogger_advanced.git`) so that the dashboard is automatically updated when new articles or comments are added.

#### Note on PrivatePub

PrivatePub doesn't seem to be particularly healthy as an OSS project. There are currently 28 issues and 5 pull requests. The most recent commit, a month ago, was Ryan adding a note saying that he isn't actively maintaining the library.

So expect some bumps along the way. Check the existing issues and pull requests if you run into problems. If you get interested in the domain, maybe fork it, merge the pull requests, and try solving some of the issues.
