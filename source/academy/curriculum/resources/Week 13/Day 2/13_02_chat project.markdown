## Big Picture

We need to build an online chat system similar to http://campfirenow.com/

### Planning & Direction

We're going to shake up the requirements process a bit. Instead of delivering you a collection of stories, you'll meet with us in a customer role and have to elicit the requirements out of us.

You'll take the notes and ideas from that meeting and use them to create your own stories, schedule them, and present them to the customer for approval.

### Systems Requirements

* VPS
* Web Server as Proxy (Apache, Nginx, etc)
* MySQL
* Redis

### Architecture Requirements

* SOA Approach
* Persistence Service
* Authentication Service
* Search Service
* File Manipulation Service
* Logging/Data Service
* Front-End Service

### How to Gather Requirements

* Identify key ideas
    * Concepts
    * Characteristics
    * Challenges
    * Characters
* Create an ubiquitous domain language
* Flesh out characters into personas
    * Motivations
    * Needs
* Hone focus via the "elevator pitch"
* Define the Minimum Viable Product
    * Prioritize user personas to service
    * Create a feature set sorted as "in" or "out"
* Develop user stories for "in" features
    * Validate with stakeholder/product owner
    * Prioritize stories, moving them "out" as needed
* Build wireframes for user stories

### Requirements Gathering

We'll put on our "customer hat" today to work with you on establishing requirements team-by-team.

Keep in mind that every conversation will be different, so you'll each have different requirements.
