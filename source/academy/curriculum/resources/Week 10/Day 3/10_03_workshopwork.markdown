## Workshop Work

Workshop time is not project time. You shouldn't open, touch, or look at your current project. This is about experimentation.

If you *need* sample code to work with, you may use any of the past projects (created by you or others). However, I'd recommend you generate a brand new application, allowing you to focus on *just* the topic you're working on.

Finally, please do not build anything of value. The code you write in the workshop should not eventually migrate into your project. It should be deleted or archived, only used as a record of what you learned.

As we talked about with Ernie yesterday, writing things the second time leads to cleaner, better solutions. Let you workshop work be the first time, then your project can be the second, beautiful time.
