## Workshop

Today let's try something a little different we're calling a "workshop." We want to encourage you to do some experimentation relevent to your projects but not actually building code.

Here are the rules for creating teams:

* You'll gather in groups of three to five
* You can't be in a group with anyone from your project team
* The group captains will each select a topic
* As a non-captain, you can choose which group to join provided there are fewer than 5 (total) in that group and that no one from your project team is in that group

The group will spend the morning period collaborating and figuring out some challenge related to our project.
