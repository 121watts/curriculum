## Researching Rails Security

Read the [Rails Security Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html) and create a few notes:

* What topics don't make sense?
* Which sections do you want to follow-up on with regards to your project?
* What are some warning signs to watch out for as you're writing code?
