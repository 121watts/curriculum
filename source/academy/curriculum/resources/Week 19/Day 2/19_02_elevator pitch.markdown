## Project Planning

For tomorrow's meeting we're expecting to see:

* An elevator pitch
* Plans for three iterations
* At least 10 stories per iteration
* Wireframes (or similar)

### Elevator Pitch

How do you explain your project in 30 seconds? It should explain:

* Who this is for
* What problem it attacks
* How the solution attacks the problem
* What kind of results you expect to see
* Action step (go sign up, or whatever -- optional)

### Iterations

* Iteration 0 should be planned in detail since you're about to start work on it. How *little* can you build before you ship? If you're not embarassed by it then you've done way too much work.
* Iteration 1 should be partly rough sketch, but can include details where they're "known" right now
* Iteration 2 should be just rough ideas. We all know that they're going to change, but we want to start with goals and make purposeful adaptations.

### Stories
