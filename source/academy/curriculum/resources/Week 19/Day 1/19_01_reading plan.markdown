## Reading Plan

Let's go through a one-week reading cycle, selecting a book today and finishing it for next Monday.

### Selection

While you may select your book, please pick something tied to one of the following areas (in order of my preference):

1. Design (UX, UI, etc)
2. Business / Product Development
3. Code Design

Ideas:

* Business (not all apply): [http://amzn.com/w/352340EAXDDSF](http://amzn.com/w/352340EAXDDSF)
* Programming: [http://amzn.com/w/K7D6CDDMZG6S](http://amzn.com/w/K7D6CDDMZG6S)

_Please keep in mind that a technical book will be very difficult to digest in a week!_

#### Deliverable

Next Monday, you'll give a 3-5 minute lightning talk about your book, reflections, and learnings.
