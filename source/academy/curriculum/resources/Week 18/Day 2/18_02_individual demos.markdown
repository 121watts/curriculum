## Individual Demos

This morning we'll do whole-group demos with a five minute timer.

During your demo try to answer these questions:

1. What's the value proposition of your app?
2. How does it work?
3. What interesting thing(s) did you learn or practice?

Then this afternoon we'll break into small groups to review your work in more detail.

Complete one review for each of your peers: [https://docs.google.com/a/hungrymachine.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEd1T0JoUlRKMlUtVEUwUk5jcC1CRUE6MQ](https://docs.google.com/a/hungrymachine.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEd1T0JoUlRKMlUtVEUwUk5jcC1CRUE6MQ)
