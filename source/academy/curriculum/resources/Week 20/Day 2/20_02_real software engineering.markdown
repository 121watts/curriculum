## Real Software Engineering

LivingSocial Engineering's Glenn Vanderburg gave a few iterations of
a talk about the relationship between engineering and building software
over the last year, including a special version as a keynote at last year's
RailsConf.

This is a video from an earlier version of the talk, given at Scottish Ruby
Conference 2011. [http://confreaks.com/videos/550-scotlandruby2011-real-software-engineering](http://confreaks.com/videos/550-scotlandruby2011-real-software-engineering)
