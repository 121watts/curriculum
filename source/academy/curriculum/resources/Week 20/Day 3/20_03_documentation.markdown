## Documentation

### Purpose and guiding principles

Documentation is meant to:

* Give big-picture understanding
* Provide insight in small cases inline to other programmers

Documentation should not:

* Echo the code
* Contradict the code
* Try to explain bad code - rewrite it!

Technical writing is one of the hardest forms of writing, should be taken
very seriously, and is enormously valueable when done well.

API documentation, in particular, is crucial.
