# Merge Sort

> Merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is an O(n log n) comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.[1] A detailed description and analysis of bottom-up mergesort appeared in a report by Goldstine and Neumann as early as 1948.[2]

## Goals

The goal of this workshop is to create an implementation of the [mergesort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) algorithm.

During the course of the workshop the emphasis is not on completing the implementation within the timeframe provided. It is about choosing and following a path.

Your path may be to understand the problem or to find an implementation in another language. You may find yourself drawn to a path which emphasizes the process or the tools you use as a craftsman. It may not even be a technical path but one in which you emphasize communication with your peer.

Use this workshop as an excuse to try something different and to fail. As the code itself you write today will not benefit you as much as your openeess to the process.

### Some Paths

We have provided some sample paths that are merely suggestions. They are here to help you find your path.

Work towards a solution:

* that brings you greater understanding of the problem

* in a new language

    > A known problem is a good opportunity to explore a new programming language. You may even select a dialect of a given language (e.g. Ruby you could implement the solution in JRuby, Rubinius).

* with an emphasis on code [clarity](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TwoTypesOfCodeClarity)

    > This path you choose may have you place emphasis on descriptive naming, explantive comments, smaller methods, or succinct implementations.

* with a test driven approach

* utilizing different development tools

* with a partner or a remote partner

    > This path may have you focus on your ability to listen; verbal or non-verbal communication. You may choose a path which explores working with a unfamilar person or someone with a different level of expertise.
