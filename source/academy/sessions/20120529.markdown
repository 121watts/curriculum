### Reading Group

#### The Lean Startup

Gather into groups of four and discuss / take notes on the group discussion questions at https://github.com/JumpstartLab/reading/tree/master/lean_startup#group-discussion

#### New Book

Paul Dix's "Service Oriented Design with Ruby and Rails": http://amzn.to/KzZVL7

Complete it by Monday 6/11. You'll need the techniques in the book for your current project, so start it soon. We'll have follow-up conversations / workshops, but there is no chapter-by-chapter assignment for this one.

### SOA Concepts

* Designing a Service
  * How little can it do?
  * How little does it need?

* Logistical Concerns
* New potentials
  * Faster development cycle
  * Easier re-implementation
  * Multiple platforms / languages
  * Reusable functionality
  * Asynchronicity 
* Breaking down "Deals"
