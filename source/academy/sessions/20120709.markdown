#### Business Needs

DonorsChoose wants to increase the total funding delivered to classrooms. Here are a few vectors of attack:

##### Donors Funding Projects

1. Donors are very proud of their donations. It would be great for them to get some extra recognition within their social and/or professional circles. How could we recognize their past giving through Facebook, LinkedIn, etc? Anything beyond just a straight history? Total impact?
2. There are a significant number of donors who joined to donate to a specific project -- they had a personal connection to it. How do we build on that connection to get them interested in other projects?
3. For repeat donors, how do we streamline the process? How little work could we make it?
4. People come to the front page, say from something a friend told them or some media exposure, and they have a "cold start." How do we help them find the projects they're interested in? Some way it could be fun? What are their passions/interests?
5. How can we help advocate donors to leverage their social and personal networks to generate more donations?

##### Teachers Posting Projects

1. Amazon will likely become an important source for most of our projects. How can we make the "shopping" process super easy for our teachers?
2. How can we leverage historical data to help teachers write better proposals? For example, can we predict how likely a proposal is to be funded based on content, size, and location?
3. Many times teachers don't realize that their friends and colleagues have posted projects on DonorsChoose, now or in the past. How can we help them connect, share tips, etc?
