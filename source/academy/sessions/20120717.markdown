### Design Critique

#### C.R.A.P

* Contrast
  * How does color affect your attention?
  * How do different content elements contrast with each other? (Font type, size, color, style, etc)
  * Squint Test
* Repetition
  * Can you find the same cues repeated throughout the page?
  * Colors
  * Shapes
  * Shadings
  * Sizes
* Alignment
  * Does everything have a place?
  * Does the grid underly the entire page?
  * Is the grid broken? Intentionally? Does it work?
  * How is the horizontal alignment of text?
* Proximity
  * Is it always clear what goes with what?
  * Is there flow to the hierarchy?
