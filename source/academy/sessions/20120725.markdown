### Project Reviews

#### Small Group Reviews

For the first phase, we'll break into pairs. Each pair will be assigned a project and an area of focus. During your work time you will:

* Review the code with respect to your area of focus
* Make an assessment (points!)
* Create a patch to improve the code
* Submit a pull request

#### Merging Patches

Now recollect in your project group and review the patches submitted to your code. 

* If they're good, merge them in and post a thanks comment.
* If they're not, write a detailed note about why the patch was rejected.
* Make sure everything still works correctly and get it up in production for tomorrow!
