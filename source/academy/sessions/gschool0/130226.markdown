## How an MVC Web Application Works

### Key Ideas

* Server IP and Port
* Receiving the Request - Router
* Processing the Request - Controller
* Business Logic & Database - Model
* Output Template - View
* Return HTML

## How Databases Work

### Key Ideas

* Databases are organized in tables
* Few tables, many rows
* Store, search, calculate, and sort
* We primarily `SELECT` data from and `INSERT` data into those tables
* Scope operations using `WHERE`
* Connect tables together using `INNER JOIN`
* Sort records with `ORDER BY`
* We create relationships between data including *one-to-one*, *one-to-many*, and *many-to-many*

## SQL and Sequel

### Sales Engine With a Database

This workshop examines using Sequel to manage the data and the relationships
found within the Sales Engine application.

* [Sequel](http://sequel.rubyforge.org/)
* [Sequel ActiveRecord Reference](http://sequel.rubyforge.org/rdoc/files/doc/active_record_rdoc.html)
