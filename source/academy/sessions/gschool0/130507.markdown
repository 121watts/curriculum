## Integrating with Instagram

For this exercise you should:

* Build a small Rails application from scratch
* Follow a normal TDD/BDD process including acceptance tests
* Use VCR to stub out the remote service

### Pairs

* Kareem Grant & Erin Drummond

### User Stories

Here's what we're looking for in the application:

```
As a public, non-authenticated user
When I visit '/'
And I enter a user id like "837"
Then I see the most recent Instagram photo from that user
```
