## Daily Outline

* Warm-up
* Class: Practical File/Folder Organization
* Class: Environment, Editor, and Tooling
* Project: SalesEngine Work Time

## Warm-Up

At 8:50 we will release today's warm-up.

This should get you the assignment:

```sh
$ cd path/to/warmup-exercises
$ git pull --rebase upstream master
```

(Note that you don't need to clone or fork or anything, since that's already done).

To get the test at 9:15, commit or stash your changes, and do another git pull.

```sh
$ git commit -m "Add solution to assignment 3"
$ git pull --rebase upstream master
```
