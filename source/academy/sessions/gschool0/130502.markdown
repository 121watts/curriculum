## Public Demos

The instructor evaluations will determine the presentations for this afternoon.

### Final Four

The *top four* projects will each give a seven minute demo of their project. It should focus on the interface and functionality. What's interesting about your project? What are the little details that make it pleasant to use?

During this prep hour, your team should put together a script/plan that outlines:

* Who has what role for the demo? (Who's running the computer, who's talking, who's standing there awkwardly)
* What order are you going to do things? (We start at the products listing, then...)
* What are the key points that you want the audience to takeaway?

Remember that this is criticially important. It's your first chance to make a real impression on people outside the class. You're probably tired and relieved to have finished the project, but 9AM was the false summit. This is the real finish line -- finish strong.

The audience will evaluate your project and demo to determine the final rankings.

Each presentation will be on a timer and Steve will start clapping you off stage when it ends.
