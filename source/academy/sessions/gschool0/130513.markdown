Before your session you **should**:

* Read the assignment
* Clone the repo: https://github.com/gSchool/scrabble
* Run `bundler` to install dependencies
* Ask classmates over Flowdock if there are details you don't understand *about the assignment*, not the implementation
* Get to your room a few minutes early
* Make sure you mind is in the right state to show off your capabilities

Before your session you **should not**:

* Begin working on the assignment
* Discuss how to implement the assignment

### Encoding and Filtering Data

First, let's learn about strategies for filtering the data provided by an API. Work through the following tutorials and exercises first:

[Encoding & Filtering JSON APIs]({% page_url topics/web_services/encoding_and_filtering %})

We've just worked on some updates for this tutorial. If you hit snags, pull requests are very much appreciated.

### Blogger API & Gem

Last week you learned about how to provide APIs from Rails ([APIs & JSON]({% page_url topics/web_services/apis_and_json %}), [Exposing an API]({% page_url topics/web_services/api %})) and how to build a wrapper library. Let's put those techniques to work:

1. Clone the Blogger project
2. Add reading API endpoints to..
  * Get a list of the `title`, `id`, and `URL` for all articles in the system
  * Retrieve the `title`, `body`, and `comments` (as a nested collection with the commentor name and text) of a specified article
3. Add writing API endpoints to...
  * Post an article
  * Post a comment to an article
4. Create a wrapper library to make the below interaction work:

{% irb %}
> blogger = Blogger.new('http://localhost:3000')
> existing_articles = blogger.articles
> new_post = blogger.create_article(:title => "API Sample Article", :body => "With quality content like this, you don't need photos.")
> blogger.articles.count - existing_articles.count
# => 1
> new_post.comments.count
# => 0
> new_post.create_comment(:name => "Mickey Mouse", :body => "Oooooh Tooooodles!")
> new_post.comments.count
# => 1
> new_post.comments.last.body == "Oooooh Tooooodles!"
# => true
{% endirb %}
