## 1-on-1s

This week you'll meet with Jeff and Katrina for about 10 minutes. Please be in the upstairs areas when it's your turn.

Discussion points:

* Were you satisfied with your work on EventReporter? If so, should you have tried to push harder? If not, how should you have attacked the process differently?
* What topic(s) "clicked" for you during the project? What's something that still tripping you up?
* What lessons or ideas will you take into the next project?
* How did you schedule/manage your work outside of class?
* How are you feeling overall? How do you feel about the remaining 24 weeks?
* Anything stopping you from doing your best work?
* Has anyone or anything make you feel hurt, scared, or offended?

## Git Dojo

When you're not having your 1-on-1, it's time to work on some git fundamentals. If you're already comfortable with the basics, then you can push your learning further.
