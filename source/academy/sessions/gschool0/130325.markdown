## Introduction to REST

* REST Intro
* REST concepts and constraints
    * Resources and URIs
    * CRUD and HTTP verbs
    * Multiple representations
    * Responsibilities of the Rails stack
* Refactor Cart and CartItem's RESTful approach
* Practical example: product reviews
    * Implement as a nested resource
    * JSON representation and form partial

<div style='width:600px'><script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="4f82d9340e58c0001f006481" data-ratio="1.299492385786802" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script></div>

### Key Ideas

* Any idea represented by a noun should probably be a resource
* Resources may or may not be persisted

### Routing

* Experimenting in the console with `app.`
* The basic `resources`
* Singular with `resource`
* Nested resources
* Custom routes
  * URL Matching with `match 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'`
  * Collection vs Member, inline and block
  * `get`, `put`, `post`, `delete`
* Namespacing
