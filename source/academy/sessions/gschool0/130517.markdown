## Retrospective

### Personal Writing

Please spend the first 35 minutes of this session (9:00-9:35), writing and posting an article on your class blog reflecting on one or more of the following questions:

* FeedEngine - What are you building? Does it feel like it could be a legit product that people want to use?
* Teamwork - You've been through the project wringer a few times now. What strategies are you using to help your team work effectively? How are they going so far? Is there anything different about how you approach a three-week team versus a two-week team?
* Jobs - If you're looking for a job after gSchool, what are some of the attributes that are most important to you about a company / position / team? How will you know when you've found the right fit?

### Group Conversation

Following the personal writing sessions, let's have a short group discussion reflecting on the week.

* What systems is your team using for organization?
* How do you feel about having more vague project requirements? And different from other teams?
* What are the big unknowns between now and delivering your project?
* What are you excited / worried about as we ramp up the job-placement process?
* Any questions for me?
* Shout-outs?

## Open Source & YA Work

Today we have four hours of work time. It's a great opportunity to actually get some things done. Choose from the following:

### Open Source

* Have you found bugs or outstanding issues with one of the API gems you're using?
* Want to write warm-up exercises for our group?
* Solve one of the warm-up exercises using JavaScript, CoffeeScript, or Elixir and put together an explanatory blog post?
* Other ideas of your own :)

### YA Work

Our YA kids will be back on Monday. You should have a final draft site done that just needs small tweaks. I'll make the photos available this morning if you'd like to use them.

You can choose to work on this project today.
