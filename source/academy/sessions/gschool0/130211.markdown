## Automated Testing Concepts

First, hop over to the [testing fundamentals page]({% page_url topics/testing/testing_fundamentals %}).

## Introduction to MiniTest

Next, let's begin rebuilding [EventManager]({% page_url projects/eventmanager %}) using a test-driven approach and the MiniTest library.

## Testing Workshop

For the afternoon, you will continue working on building EventManager using TDD. You may elect to (A) stay in the main classroom as Jeff works through it aloud or (B) go to the other classroom and work on it independently *in a pair*. Katrina will assign and support the pairs.
