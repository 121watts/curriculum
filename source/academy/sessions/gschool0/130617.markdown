## Networking, Servers, and Ops



## Reading Group: JavaScript Patterns

Let's kick off Stoyan Stefanov's "JavaScript Patterns" book today with a reading session. For next Monday, please read and experiment with *chapters 1 through 5 (up to page 114)*. Take this hour to get started.

If you've already read that far, please try to gather with other students who have done the same and conduct some experiments, answer each other's questions, etc.
