## Daily Outline

* Warm-Up
* Class: Just Enough Agile
* Class: Introducing SalesEngine
* Class: Introduction to Pivotal Tracker
* Project Work: Planning Sales Engine

## Warm-Up

At 8:50 we will release a new warm-up exercise to the [warmup-exercises](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/warmup-exercises) repository.

`git pull` to get the assignment. You have until 9:15 to complete your program.

At 9:15 `git commit` your code and `git pull --rebase` to get the tests, and run the tests against your program.

## Just Enough Agile

Projects are more likely to fail because of people problems than technical problems, and people problems often stem from poor organization. Both in our projects and in the real world, organizing your work is essential to success.

Let's talk about the basics of the agile methodology and how it'll apply to our work.

### Development Methodologies

#### Waterfall

* Gather and agree upon complete requirements
* Design the components of the system with their interactions/interfaces
* Implement the design
* Verify that the implementation realizes the requirements
* Maintain the software as necessary

#### Agile

It's complicated.

##### Agile Principles by Kent Beck

* Customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of useful software
* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
* Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
* Working software is the principal measure of progress
* Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
* Close, daily co-operation between business people and developers
* Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
* Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
* Simplicity is essential
* Self-organizing teams
* Regular adaptation to changing circumstances

##### Scrum Development

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)
* Key components:
  * iteration / sprint
  * backlog
  * meetings

### Stories

* Stories are our "to-do" items
* "As a <role>, I want <goal/desire> so that <benefit>"
* Focus on the value delivered
* Gherkin language is one option:

```
 1: Feature: Some terse yet descriptive text of what is desired
 2:   In order to realize a named business value
 3:   As an explicit system actor
 4:   I want to gain some beneficial outcome which furthers the goal
 5: 
 6:   Scenario: Some determinable business situation
 7:     Given some precondition
 8:       And some other precondition
 9:      When some action by the actor
10:       And some other action
11:       And yet another action
12:      Then some testable outcome is achieved
13:       And something else we can check happens too
```
