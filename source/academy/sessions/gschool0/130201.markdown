## Building an Identity

It's important that you start to build a representative and consistent identity. The Ruby world is very network dependent, and your identity/network will have a significant impact on your future.

Several to-do items for you:

* Take your new headshot and associate it with all your email addresses on [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com)
* Setup an account on Twitter if you haven't already
* Make sure your Github profile is complete and has your email and twitter accounts
* Create a professional blog using the notes below
