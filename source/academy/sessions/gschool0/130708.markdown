## Reviewing JavaScript Fundamentals

Key concepts we'll discuss:

* Where JavaScript is used (inside and outside the browser)
* Functions & syntax
* Events
* API Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
* JavaScript Guide: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide

## Practicing JavaScript

### Beginner Level

If you're feeling like a total beginner with JavaScript...

* find someone to pair with
* read through and experiment with our JS tutorials:
  * [JavaScript in the Page](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/javascript/introduction/1-javascript-in-the-page.html)
  * [JavaScript Basics](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/javascript/introduction/2-javascript-basics.html)
  * [DOM Basics](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/javascript/introduction/3-dom-basics.html)
* read and work through the [MDN JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)

### Intermediate Level

More than anything else, you just need to practice.

* find someone to pair with
* work on warmup problems in JavaScript:
  * [03-scrabble](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/warmup-exercises/tree/master/03-scrabble)
  * [12-wordy-calculator](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/warmup-exercises/tree/master/12-wordy-calculator)
  * [28-binary-secret-handshake](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/warmup-exercises/tree/master/28-binary-secret-handshake)
  * [31-anagram](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/warmup-exercises/tree/master/31-anagram)
  * [32-allergies](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/warmup-exercises/tree/master/32-allergies)

## Mastery Project Kickoff

The last project is here! For the mastery project we want to see what you can do.

1. Choose whether you want to work by yourself or with a group
2. Decide on a project

### Project Selection

You might choose to:

* Continue work on your individual project
* Take someone else's individual project and build upon it
* Adopt any of the past group projects and push them forward
* Start something from scratch

### Project Expectations

This is the evidence that you're now a competent, professional developer. Things we're looking for:

* Solid programming practices
  * Good object design and decomposition
  * High coverage and effectiveness in testing
  * Attention to security and performance
  * Breaking out asyncronous jobs
  * Pulling out services
* Solid business processes
  * Delivering plausible value to the user
  * Implementing a clear design and user experience
  * Effective project management with stories, iterations, etc
* Pushing your boundaries
  * Integrating at least one technology that makes you uncomfortable on the **backend** (ex: Mongo, Riak, Python, Cassandra, etc)
  * Integrating at least one technology that makes you uncomfortable on the **frontend** (ex: Backbone.js, D3, Underscore.js, Canvas, Raphael.js, Mobile/text/voice, iOS/RubyMotion)
  * Doing things the way you know they should be done, not cutting corners
