### Getting Started

When you're not in a requirements session:

* Select a [Son of Store Engine codebase](https://github.com/gSchool/submissions/blob/master/projects/son_of_store_engine.markdown) that you'll build upon
* Begin exploring the codebase
  * What are its strengths and weaknesses?
  * How is the test support? Strip out anything that isn't in use or useful.
  * Assuming there are areas without satisfactory tests, how can you get the code under test?

## Lightning Talks
