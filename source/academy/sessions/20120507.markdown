### Schedule for Today

* Opening
* What is an API?
* Getting Started with JSON
* Bryan Helmcamp & Code Climate
* Exposing JSON in Rails
* Reading Group: Pragmatic Programmer

### What is an API?

* Technical: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface
* We use "API" in two contexts:
  * Libraries/Classes
  * External Services
* Communication Patterns
  * Client/Server protocol
* Communication Language
  * Plain text?
  * XML
  * JSON

### Getting Started with JSON

JSON has...

* Curly Brackets
* Colons
* String labels
* Typed Data: 
  * String
  * Number
  * Array
  * Boolean

#### In Ruby

* http://flori.github.com/json/

Experiments:

```
JSON.parse('{"first":"Hello","second":"World"}')
JSON.parse({"first" => "Hello", "second" => "World"}.to_json)
JSON.parse('{"third":[4,5],"fourth":true}')
"Hello, World".to_json
require 'date'; Date.today.to_json
{"hello" => "world"}.to_json
```

Observe the data types in this example:

```
content = {:outer => {:inner => "content", :inner2 => "content2"}, :outer2 => true}
output = content.to_json
content == JSON.parse(output)
```

Interesting?
