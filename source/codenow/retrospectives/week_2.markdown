Let's spend a few minutes looking back at the week.

## Setup

* Use SublimeText to create a file `C:\Users\codenow\retrospectives\week_2.markdown`
* Write your retro in that text file

## Personal Retrospective

Spend the next 15 minutes answering one or more of the following questions:

### Subjects We've Studied

* So far you've studied pure Ruby, Ruby-Processing, and Sinatra. Which has been your favorite to work with? Why?
* How might you use the skills we've practiced so far on a project of your own?

### Yourself & Your Progress

* Now that we've been at it for a week and a half, do you feel like you're building momentum?
* 

* Before this week you've spent at least six days learning Ruby.
  * Did you remember how to program?
  * What parts of this week were harder than you expected?
  * What parts were easy?
* Ruby Warrior
  * We spent a lot of time working on Ruby Warrior. Why?
  * Do you think a game is an effective way to learn? Why or why not?
  * We said that the "instructions were easy, the algorithm was hard" -- what did that mean? What's the difference between the instructions and the algorithm?
* Processing
  * What's easy in Processing? What's hard?
  * Why do you think we spent time working with Processing?
