## Finishing IdeaBox

We've got the last two iterations of IdeaBox in place. [Hop over to the tutorial]({% page_url projects/idea_box %}) and finish it off!

## Database Foundations @ Treehouse

Please work through the [Introduction to Data, Databases, and SQL](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/database-foundations/introduction-to-data-databases-and-sql-2) track on Treehouse.

## Getting Started with Rails

This afternoon, let's dig into Rails (aka Ruby on Rails). We'll build a short project that uses a lot of Rails' automation to get going quickly.
