## Developing a Learning Track

The learning track would attract developers who self-identify as new to the community. Many attendees who would actually benefit from the content will be too embarassed by their lack of expertise to participate. The ones who show up will be those that aren't afraid to say "I'm new and I need help!"

For these persons, it makes the most sense to craft a hands-on, supported experience.

### Structural Plan

To not conflict with keynote sessions, the day will run from 10am to 4pm with one hour for lunch.

Under that plan, each day will feature:

* A two-hour morning session focused on fundamentals
* A 1.5-hour afternoon session focused on higher-level topics
* A 1.5-hour afternoon session to "wow" with unusual Ruby/Rails projects

#### Morning Sessions

A hands-on-keyboards guided tutorial:

* <10 minutes - Introduction & Goal Setting
* 20 minutes - Follow-Along Tutorial Part 1
* 5 minutes - break
* 25 minutes - Follow-Along Tutorial Part 2
* 5 minutes - break
* 25 minutes - Follow-Along Tutorial Part 3
* 5 minutes - break
* 25 minutes - Independent Work

#### Afternoon Sessions

More of a lecture with activities approach:

* <5 minutes - Introduction & Goal Setting
* 25 minutes - Lecture / Example
* 5 minutes - break
* 25 minutes - Guided Exercise
* 5 minutes - break
* 25 minutes - Independent Work

### What Will Go Wrong

#### Machine Setup

Configuration of dev machines is still difficult. Even if we know the steps, it may mean downloading large binaries over a thin pipe.

##### Possible Solutions

* Distributed USB drives with common needs
* Local network server for rubies, gems
* "Install fest" ahead of time
