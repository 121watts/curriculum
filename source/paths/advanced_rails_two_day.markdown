## Setting Expectations

### Is this the right session for you?

You belong here if:

* You feel *very* comfortable working with Ruby and Rails
* You have built several Rails projects
* You're interested in some new ideas
* You're willing to wrestle with things that might not work the first time

This is *not* a good session for you if:

* You're new to Ruby/Rails
* You want everything to go smoothly

### Are you prepared?

You need:

* To join the chatroom at http://jumpstartlab.com/chat
* Ruby 1.9.2 or greater
* Rails 3.1.3 or greater
* Setup the sample project

{% include custom/sample_project_advanced.html %}

You can also run the tests continuously as we make changes by starting `guard`
