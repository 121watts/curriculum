# Heroku Notes & To-Dos

## To-Dos

### Heroku-Side

* [Tammy] Setup redemption codes for $25 credit for each attendee

### Formatting

* [Jorge] Remove the page breaks after headings -- they somehow came back?
* [Jorge] Hide the footer when printing, it shows up in a random place
* [Jorge] If there's a "back" attribute, then add a link at the bottom of the tutorial which is hidden in print

### Edits

* [Jorge] How to generate SSH keys for OS X
* [Jorge] How to generate SSH keys for windows -- (Fix the path on Windows for the ssh-generator / SET PATH=%PATH%;C:/Program Files/)

### New Content

### Questions

* Is the git-involvement simple enough?
* Why suggest that I get a developer edition when we didnâ€™t use it?

### To-Do Later

* End morning with a quiz and prizes - give out tshirt or credits - ask questions about what they learned
* Extension: actually make the sample app compliant with the Canvas API
* [Josh] Implment the `generate_requests` functionality described in Maximizing Heroku
