## To-Dos

### Heroku-Side

* [Tammy] Setup redemption codes for $25 credit for each attendee

### Formatting

* [Jorge] Remove the page breaks after headings -- they somehow came back?
* [Jorge] Hide the footer when printing, it shows up in a random place

### Edits

* [Jorge] How to generate SSH keys for OS X
* [Jorge] How to generate SSH keys for windows -- (Fix the path on Windows for the ssh-generator / SET PATH=%PATH%;C:/Program Files/)

### New Content

* [Josh] Write Measuring Application Performance with NewRelic
* Add screenshots for Connect, how to signup for the beta, etc
* Drawings: "what is Heroku?" and "how connect works"
* Add a scaling exercise that runs a bunch of requests on a single dyno, 2x dyno, etc

### Questions

* Is the git-involvement simple enough?
* Why suggest that I get a developer edition when we didnâ€™t use it?

### To-Do Later

* End morning with a quiz and prizes - give out tshirt or credits - ask questions about what they learned
* Extension: actually make the sample app compliant with the Canvas API
