### Edits

* Mention that you need to add a credit card to your Heroku account to scale

### New Content

* Add NewRelic
* Add bits about the DevCenter
* End morning with a quiz and prizes - give out tshirt or credits - ask questions about what they learned
* Afternoon hands-on exercise needed
* Add screenshots for Connect, how to signup for the beta, etc
* Drawings: "what is Heroku?" and "how connect works"
* Add Canvas section after lunch
* Add a scaling exercise that runs a bunch of requests on a single dyno, 2x dyno, etc

### Questions

* Is the git-involvement simple enough?
* Why suggest that I get a developer edition when we didn’t use it?

### Other
