## Systems Setup

To get the most out of the workshop you should be working along with us. Before we get going, please go through the [Systems Setup](/paths/elevate/systems_setup.html) tutorial.

## Why Heroku?

Before we get into the technical details, let's talk about why you should care by exploring a few use cases.

Click over to [Why Heroku](/paths/elevate/why_heroku.html).

## How Heroku Works

Heroku is a cloud hosting platform designed and built for developers. Before you can get your application up and running we should explore how the platform works.

Jump over to the [How Heroku Works](/paths/elevate/how_heroku_works.html) tutorial.

## Deploying Java Applications on Heroku

Now that you understand the basics of how Heroku works, let's actually deploy an application. Head over to the [Deploying a Java](/paths/elevate/deploying_java_applications.html) tutorial.

## Maximizing Heroku's Platform

You've gotten an application up and running, but how do you make sure it stays up and highly responsive?

Let's look at [How to Maximize Heroku](/paths/elevate/maximizing_heroku.html).

## Measuring Application Performance with NewRelic

Let's dig deeper into performance and experiment with the New Relic performance monitoring integration.

Work along with the [Measuring Application Performance with NewRelic](/paths/elevate/measuring_application_performance.html) tutorial.

## Integrating Salesforce with Heroku Connect

There are many ways that Java applications can interact with Salesforce data. Let's use the REST API to move data back and forth in the [Integrating Salesforce](/paths/elevate/integrating_salesforce) tutorial.

## For Future Reference

* The best resource for detailed Heroku knowledge is the [Dev Center](https://Dev Center.heroku.com/).
