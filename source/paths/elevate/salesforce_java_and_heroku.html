### Systems Setup

To get the most out of the workshop you should be working along with us. Before we get going, please go through the following setup steps.

#### Git

We'll need Git to handle source control and facilitate pushing code to Heroku. You can find installer packages for any platform at http://git-scm.com/downloads or:

* On Linux, use apt: `sudo apt-get install git-core`
* On MacOS [use Homebrew](http://brew.sh) if it's installed: `brew install git`
* On Windows, [download the installer](http://git-scm.com/download/win)
