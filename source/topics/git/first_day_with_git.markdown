Today our goal is to both understand both (a) why and (b) how to use Git.

## Background

First let's set the stage and discuss Git at a high level.

* What is source control?
* Why use it?
* What came before git?
* What's in use now?
* Why was it created?
* What's the difference between git and GitHub?
* Centralized vs distributed source control
* Repo, branch, commit

## Source Control Made Easy

The late, great Jim Weirich explains source control and git better than we can. Let's check out his screencast:

## Try Git / Git Immersion

Now let's put in a bit of practice.

If you're brand new to git, start with try.github: https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1

If you've used git before (or complete try.github), work through Git Immersion: http://gitimmersion.com/

## Extra Challenge

Read about [the "Git Flow" workflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/),
one opinion about how to run releases and git branches. There's also a [screencast
by our friend Dave Bock](http://nvie.com/posts/a-git-flow-screencast/).

Dive in a little more deeply to understand rebasing:

* [From Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/rewriting-git-history#!rebase)
* [From Gitready](http://gitready.com/intermediate/2009/01/31/intro-to-rebase.html)
* [From mettadore.com](http://mettadore.com/analysis/a-simple-git-rebase-workflow-explained/)

And, if you just can't get enough Git, check out the Pro Git book: http://git-scm.com/book
