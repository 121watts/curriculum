<p><strong>Rails</strong> 3.1</p>

<p>Migrations have always been considered one of the many killer features in Rails. And in Rails 3.1 Migrations got a new trick up their sleeve that will greatly simplify the process of maintaining both the <code>up</code> and <code>down</code> logic. If you need a little refresher on what migrations are then I suggest reading the official <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html">Rails guide</a>.</p>

<p>Lets start by looking at how a typical migration looks like in Rails 3.0</p>

<pre lang="ruby"><code>  class CreatePosts &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      create_table :posts do |t|
        t.string :title
        t.text :body

        t.timestamps
      end
    end

    def self.down
      drop_table :postss
    end
  end
</code></pre>
