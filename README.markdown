## Setup

To view the tutorials:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ArchitectureInnovation/Ruby-on-Rails-Training.git
cd Ruby-on-Rails-Training/
bundle
bundle exec rackup
```

Then open http://localhost:9292/ in your browser.

## Issues

* Code highlighting needs better styling, especially in the Router section
* Layout is still messy
* Lots of tutorials to write
