## Setup

To view/edit the tutorials:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ArchitectureInnovation/Ruby-on-Rails-Training.git
bundle
bundle exec jekyll
```

Then visit http://localhost:4000/tutorials/index.html

## Issues

* Code highlighting library is not yet cooperating.
* Haven't found a good way to make anchor tags for linking within tutorials
