# Jumpstart Lab Curriculum

## Installation

### Ruby

Using RVM or rbenv, visit the project directory and the tool will guide you through installation. On ubuntu, system ruby-1.9.3-p290 works fine.

### Gems

```bash
bundle
```

### Developing

To keep the server running live and updating, run:

```bash
bundle exec rake preview
```

Once that has finished booting you can visit (localhost:4000)[http://localhost:4000] to view the curriculum. When you make changes, they will automatically be reflected. It may take a few seconds and you may need to disable caching.

Make edits via the `/source` folder.

## Online
